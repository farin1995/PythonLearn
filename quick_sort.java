Hereâ€™s a concise implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm in Java:

Copy the code
public class QuickSort {

    // Method to partition the array
    private static int partition(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
        int pivot = arr[high];
        int i = low - 1;

        for (int j = low; j < high; j++) {
            if (arr[j] < pivot) {
                i++;
                // Swap arr[i] and arr[j]
                int temp = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[j];
                arr[j] = temp;
            }
        }

        // Swap arr[i+1] and pivot (arr[high])
        int temp = arr[i + 1];
        arr[i + 1] = arr[high];
        arr[high] = temp;

        return i + 1;
    }

    // Recursive Quick Sort method
    private static void quickSort(int[] arr, int low, int high) {
        if (low < high) {
            int pi = partition(arr, low, high);

            // Recursively sort elements before and after partition
            quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);
            quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high);
        }
    }

    // Main method to test the Quick Sort
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5};
        int n = arr.length;

        quickSort(arr, 0, n - 1);

        System.out.println("Sorted array:");
        for (int num : arr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}

Explanation:
Partitioning: The array is divided around a pivot such that elements smaller than the pivot are on the left, and elements larger are on the right.
Recursion: The process is repeated for the left and right subarrays.
Base Case: The recursion stops when the subarray has one or no elements.

This implementation is efficient and works well for most cases. Let me know if you'd like further clarification! ðŸ˜Š
